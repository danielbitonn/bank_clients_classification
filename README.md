## **Business Motivation**
There has been a revenue decline in some banks, and they would like to know what actions to take. 

After investigation, they found that the root cause was that their customers were not investing enough for long-term deposits.

The marketing campaigns required high costs and much effort based on phone calls. More than one contact with the same client was often necessary to verify if a long-term deposit is relevant and if the customer will invest in  (**'yes'** or **'no'**).

Therefore the bank would like to identify existing customers that have a higher chance of subscribing to a long-term deposit base on their internal data and focus marketing efforts on such.

> The Target is to classify a customer who would be (**'YES' or 'NO'**) a subscriber of a long-term deposit investment based on his banking data.
